# Discount Implementation Fix Guide

## Overview
The discount functionality is properly implemented in the UI components and TypeScript code, but there are database schema and data flow issues that need to be resolved.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Database Schema Issues
- The `discount` column may not exist in the `products` table
- The `original_price` and `discount_applied` columns may not exist in the `order_items` table
- Missing database indexes for performance

### 2. Product Store Issues
- The `discount` field was not being included in database operations (FIXED)
- Missing discount field in fetch, add, and update operations (FIXED)

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Product Store (`/stores/productStore.ts`)
✅ **COMPLETED**: Updated all database operations to include the `discount` field:
- `fetchProducts()` - Now includes discount in the mapped product data
- `addProduct()` - Now saves discount to database
- `updateProduct()` - Now updates discount in database

### 2. Created Database Fix Script (`/lib/final-discount-fix.sql`)
✅ **CREATED**: Comprehensive SQL script that:
- Adds missing columns if they don't exist
- Creates necessary indexes
- Adds helpful comments
- Provides verification queries
- Includes sample discount data format

## Required Actions

### 1. Run Database Fix Script
**CRITICAL**: Execute `/lib/final-discount-fix.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- This script will:
-- 1. Add discount column to products table
-- 2. Add original_price column to order_items table  
-- 3. Add discount_applied column to order_items table
-- 4. Create performance indexes
-- 5. Add helpful comments
-- 6. Verify schema
```

### 2. Test Discount Functionality
After running the database script, test the following:

#### Admin Functions:
1. **Create Product with Discount**:
   - Go to Admin → Products → Add Product
   - Fill in product details
   - Set a product-level discount (percentage or flat)
   - Save product
   - Verify discount is saved in database

2. **Edit Product Discount**:
   - Go to Admin → Products → Edit existing product
   - Modify the discount value
   - Save changes
   - Verify discount is updated

#### Customer Functions:
1. **View Product with Discount**:
   - Browse products as customer
   - Products with discounts should show:
     - Discount badge on product cards
     - Original price (struck through)
     - Discounted price (highlighted)

2. **Add to Cart with Discount**:
   - Add discounted product to cart
   - Cart should show:
     - Original price (struck through)
     - Discounted price
     - Total savings

3. **Place Order with Discount**:
   - Complete order placement
   - Verify order_items table contains:
     - `price`: discounted price
     - `original_price`: original price
     - `discount_applied`: discount JSON

## Current Discount Logic

### Product-Level Discounts Only
- ✅ Each product can have ONE discount (percentage or flat amount)
- ✅ No individual variation-level discounts (simplified as requested)
- ✅ Discount applies to all variations of the product

### Discount Types
```typescript
interface Discount {
  type: 'percentage' | 'flat';
  value: number; // 0-100 for percentage, any positive number for flat
}
```

### Examples:
```json
// 10% discount
{"type": "percentage", "value": 10}

// ₹50 flat discount  
{"type": "flat", "value": 50}
```

### Calculation Logic
- **Percentage**: `discountedPrice = originalPrice * (1 - value/100)`
- **Flat**: `discountedPrice = max(0, originalPrice - value)`

## UI Components Status

### ✅ Working Components:
1. **ProductCard** - Shows discount badge and pricing
2. **Product Detail Page** - Shows discount information and savings
3. **CartItem** - Shows original and discounted prices
4. **Cart Page** - Shows total savings and original vs final totals
5. **Add/Edit Product Forms** - Discount input fields

### ✅ Features Implemented:
- Discount badges on product cards
- Original price strikethrough
- Discounted price highlighting
- Savings calculation and display
- Cart total with discount breakdown
- Order placement with discount tracking

## Database Schema

### Products Table
```sql
ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN discount JSONB DEFAULT NULL;
```

### Order Items Table
```sql
ALTER TABLE order_items ADD COLUMN original_price DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT NULL;
ALTER TABLE order_items ADD COLUMN discount_applied JSONB DEFAULT NULL;
```

## Verification Steps

### 1. Database Schema Check
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name IN ('products', 'order_items') 
  AND column_name IN ('discount', 'original_price', 'discount_applied')
  AND table_schema = 'public';
```

### 2. Test Product Creation
1. Create a product with 10% discount
2. Verify in database: `SELECT discount FROM products WHERE name = 'Test Product';`
3. Should return: `{"type": "percentage", "value": 10}`

### 3. Test Order Placement
1. Add discounted product to cart
2. Place order
3. Check order_items table for discount tracking

## Next Steps

1. **Execute the database fix script** (`/lib/final-discount-fix.sql`)
2. **Test product creation** with discounts
3. **Test order placement** with discounted items
4. **Verify discount display** in all UI components
5. **Test discount calculations** are accurate

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the database schema is properly updated
2. Verify the product store changes are deployed
3. Test with simple percentage discounts first
4. Check browser console for any TypeScript errors
5. Verify Supabase connection and permissions

The discount system is now fully implemented and ready for testing once the database schema is updated.
